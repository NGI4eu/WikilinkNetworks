WikilinkNetworks
================

The script creates a network of Wikpedia articles based on the links written into the text of the articles as wikilinks. 

This is achieved by parsing the text of all the articles in the network; the result is different from just querying the Wikipedia API to retrieve the links (in which case, also links generated by templates would be included).
