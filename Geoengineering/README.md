This folder contains a hyperlink network of Wikipedia articles related to *Geoengineering*: 
* in csv format, as a simple list of directed edges from a source article to a target article;
* in the [GEFX open format](http://gexf.net/format/).

The network was created on July 2013, starting from a manually selected seed list of 39 articles related to Geoengineering (file [Geongineering_seed.txt](https://github.com/sdivad/WikilinkNetworks/blob/master/Geoengineering/Geoengineering_seed.txt)). The list was expanded to include all articles connected (in any direction) with at least two articles in the seed. In all the process, only wikilinks included in the text of the articles were considered (links automatically created by templates were discarded).
